      "ai": "Hi there!\n\nA Data Analyst plays a crucial role in helping organizations make sense of their data. They collect, process, and perform statistical analyses on data to identify trends, patterns, and insights. Their main goal is to translate complex datasets into understandable information that can be used to improve business decisions, optimize processes, and solve problems. This often involves creating reports, dashboards, and visualizations to present their findings to stakeholders.\n\nIt looks like I don't have any specific job postings for Data Analyst roles to show you right now. Would you like me to search for something else, or perhaps refine your search criteria?"

Also, please note that while I can search for IT jobs, I don't have a \"posted date\" attribute to filter by recency, so I can't guarantee they would be the absolute \"latest\" even when the system is fully operational.\n\nPlease try again a bit later, or let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!"
